# PianoPitchPerfect

Welcome to Piano Pitch Perfect! This is my in-progress piano sight-reading application. As of now, it performs an FFT on audio input and processes it, ultimately comparing it to target frequencies. I've uploaded mainly the back-end of my application to the repo, and I'm currently working a fornt-end design for my application. Feel free to peruse the code at your leisure.
